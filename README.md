# RepYourBlock

RepYourBlock is a community-led campaign of New Kings Democrats to help everyday Brooklynites, like you, reform local government by winning a seat on the 5,000-member Kings County Democratic Committee (a.k.a. the Brooklyn Democratic Party).

This repository includes the code to make walksheets to support the petitioning process.
